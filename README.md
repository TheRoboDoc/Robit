# Robit
Robit is a small Discord bot made by RoboDoc. It can answer messages when pinged in them. It uses [OpenAI ChatGPT 3.5 Turbo](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) for that.
It uses [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) for Discord API interactions.
Since version 0.4.0 Robit uses ffmpeg to convert video and image formats.
Robit also supports image generation via [DeepAI Text To Image](https://deepai.org/machine-learning-model/text2img)
