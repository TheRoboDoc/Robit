# Robit
Robit is a small Discord bot made by RoboDoc. At the moment he can only play music.
It uses [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) for Discord API interactions and to play and fetch music it uses [LavaLink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink). LavaLink uses [OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/) to run. This bot also does "AI interactions" via [OpenAI API for Text Davinci V3](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3)

Currently in very early stages of development and doesn't even have a server to be hosted on.
