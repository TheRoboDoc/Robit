# Robit
Robit is a small Discord bot made by RoboDoc. At the moment the bot can play music and have simple interactions if it gets pinged in a message. It uses [OpenAI API Text Davinci V3](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3) for that.
It uses [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) for Discord API interactions and to play and fetch music it uses [LavaLink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink). LavaLink uses [OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/) to run.
