# Robit
Robit is a small Discord bot made by RoboDoc. At the moment it can only play music.
It uses [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) for Discord API interactions and to play and fetch music it uses [LavaLink](https://github.com/freyacodes/Lavalink). LavaLink uses [OpenJDK](https://adoptium.net/) to run

Currently in very early stages of development and doesn't even have a server to be hosted on.

[Invite Robit to your Discord server](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1049457745763500103&permissions=964257377344&scope=bot%20applications.commands)

He is currently running on a VM on my Desktop PC :\
