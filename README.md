# Robit
Robit is a small Discord bot made by RoboDoc. It can answer messages when pinged in them. It uses [OpenAI API Text Davinci V3](https://beta.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3) for that.
It uses [DSharpPlus](https://github.com/DSharpPlus/DSharpPlus) for Discord API interactions.

You can add Robit to your server [here](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1049457745763500103&permissions=139623525440&scope=bot%20applications.commands)
